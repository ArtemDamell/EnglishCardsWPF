# English Cards WPF
## This program was created by me using WPF technology in 2017. The code has undergone minor fixes, but overall it remains at the same level as it was.

It is a fairly simple application that displays flashcards and writes words in both English and Russian. It also plays recordings of the pronunciation in both English and Russian.
